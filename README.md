##Making friends in your 20's is extremely difficult, and all the transitions that happen don't make it easier. As college students in our 20's, this project abstoluly had some passion behind it as that is our situation as well as our peers.
#We would like to introduce you to Pals! A friendship connection site that helps you make "Friends through the ages". We offer classes that help you make friends through activies such as yoga, golfing, etc. We offer weekly events for you to make friends in a fun and safe environment, as well as overall support. We understand that startin conversations is hard and people judge books by there cover; which is why we had open ended and fun questions to help make this process easier. Other users can not see your profile picture, till the initial conversation is completed.
