      <p> After college, I recently moved to a different state and found myself alone, having difficulty making friends. With PALs, I could navigate making friends with ease and comfort. PALS matched me with people who enjoyed the same things I do, like rollerblading or swimming with sharks. Thank you, PALS, for the friends I will have through the ages.</p>

      <p>Now that I am approaching my thirties, I find myself losing friends due to them moving or having kids. I began to feel lonely. Then I heard about PALS. After finishing my profile, it took no time for them to match me with people who had the same hobbies as I. It has been a few months, and I have been having a great time going to goat yoga with my new friends. Thanks, PALS, for making me friends I will have through the ages.</p>

      <p>Everyone always told me it is easy to make friends in college. After classes ended for the semester,
         all the friends I made seemed to fade away. However, one day walking to class, I was given a flyer
          for PALS. I decided to give it a shot since I did not know what else to do, and I was getting pretty
           lonely. I am so grateful that I did. I made a group of new friends who have been with me through thick
            and thin for the past year and a half. Because of PALS fantastic ability to match people with similar 
            interests, I went on a humanitarian trip with my new friends to help flood victims.</p>
